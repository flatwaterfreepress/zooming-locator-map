# Zooming locator map
*Slowly fly to a location with Mapbox GL JS*

Use: In a story about Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's pig farms, which are spread throughout the state, this map was used next to a farm image to help readers better picture the farm's location.

Process: Used MacOS screen recording tool to capture a short video of the zoom action, then looped the video inside the website CMS.

Note: Our custom map style starts with a simplified street view at high levels, then switches to satellite imagery when zoomed (level 10+) to show site details.
