# Zooming locator map
Slowly fly to a location with Mapbox GL JS. 

Based on: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/flyto-options/

Once the map was finished, we used the MacOS screen recording tool to capture a short video of the zoom action, then looped the video inside the CMS next to an image of the location.
